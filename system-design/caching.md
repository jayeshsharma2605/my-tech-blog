# Caching
Caching means **keeping a copy of something in a “quick access” place** so you don’t have to fetch or calculate it again.
Think of it like **keeping snacks on your desk** instead of going to the kitchen every time you’re hungry.

# Why Do We Need Caching?
    

 1. Speed: Getting data from cache is much faster than going back to the original source (like a database or API).
 Example: Instead of asking the library for the same book every time, you keep a copy at home.
 
 2. Reduce Load: Saves work for the main system (database, server, or API).
    Example: If 100 people ask the same question, the answer can come from cache instead of the teacher repeating it 100 times.
    
 3. Cost Saving: Accessing the source repeatedly can be expensive (time, bandwidth, computing power).         
    Cache makes it cheaper.
